#### Fantastic Flamingos Project 2
###### Featuring:
Ben Hanson
Elise Macabou
Joe Cohen

This project was done by all three of us on one VM that we used for testing! We used pair programming and group discussion to develop and debug it together. At first we ran into some issues with how we would dynamically allocate memory, but we were able to figure it out. Then we ran into some trouble with the producer thread not ending correctly. We were able to fix this by correcting the producer function not to end before it is triggered to. The consumer thread 0 seems to take up a lot of the tasks sometimes and we are not sure why it gets so much priority but the other ones join in too sometimes. Thank you for reading!
