#### Fantastic Flamingos Project 2
###### Featuring:
Ben Hanson

This project was done by all three of us on a VM that we used for testing! We used pair programming and group discussion to develop and debug it together. At first we ran into some issues with using mmap on our VM. We fixed this by changing the VM to the ones that the TA's provided. Then we ran into some trouble with the HRTimer. It would not initialize correctly because we did not include the .function requirement (this was because it was not mentioned in the project description. We were able to find it online and proceed from there. After these issues, it was smooth sailing to get it working. 

Note: Test case 3 prints the information twice. Iteration 1 is normal, but iteration 2 includes the dmesg output from iteration 1, and iteration 3 includes the dmesg output from iteration 2.

Thank you for reading!
